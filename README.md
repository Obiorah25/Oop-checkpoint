REST API with Node.js, Express, and Mongoose
This project is a simple REST API built using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. The API allows for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database. The API manages user data, allowing you to retrieve, add, edit, and delete users from the database.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager)
MongoDB (for local development) or MongoDB Atlas (for cloud-based development)
Postman (for testing the API)
Instructions
1. Initialize a New Node.js Project
Start by creating a new Node.js project using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm init
This will create a package.json file for managing dependencies and scripts.

2. Install Required Packages
Install the necessary packages, including Express for building the server, Mongoose for database manipulation, and dotenv for environment variable management:

bash
Copy code
npm install express mongoose dotenv
3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the config/ folder to store environment variables, such as the MongoDB connection string:

bash
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
4. Launch the Server with Express
Create a server.js file to set up the Express server. This file will also handle routing and database connection.

5. Connect to MongoDB
In server.js, connect to your MongoDB database either locally or using MongoDB Atlas. Use Mongoose to manage this connection.

6. Define a Mongoose Schema
Create a models/ folder and a User.js file inside it. Define a Mongoose Schema for the User model and export it to be used in server.js.

7. Implement API Routes
In server.js, create the following routes to manipulate user data:

GET /users: Return all users from the database.
POST /users: Add a new user to the database.
PUT /users/:id: Edit an existing user by their ID.
DELETE /users/:id: Remove a user by their ID.
Each route's callback function should use Mongoose methods to interact with the database and return the appropriate response.

8. Test Your API
Use Postman to test each of the API routes:

GET: Check if all users are returned correctly.
POST: Ensure a new user can be added to the database.
PUT: Verify that a user's information can be updated by their ID.
DELETE: Confirm that a user can be deleted by their ID.
Comment Your Code
Ensure that all your code is well-commented before submission. This helps others understand your logic and flow.

Conclusion
This project provides a basic template for creating a REST API with Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. It can be easily extended to include more complex functionality as needed.
